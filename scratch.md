Some thoughts on Editing and Veneration

Most works which end up being published see the hand of the editor. For those writers who become published only after their death, this becomes something which they have both the good fortune and the misfortune of lacking. Who would dare to edit Kafka? And yet he is no intrinsically less likely to have benefited from this than any author who published before their death. This is not to say that Kafka definitely could have benefited from editing, I wouldn't presume to say this, particularly since I do not speak or read German. Nevertheless, it is odd the way the departed artist is venerated to the degree that we perhaps withhold from them tools which we freely give our contemporaries.


And what would Kafka himself say of this? We cannot know. It is true that he directed to have his works burned after his death, but he did so in the same way an inebriated bar patron may ask their companions to hold them back, hoping that they in turn do no such thing.
