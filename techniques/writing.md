Speed Writing: Set a timer for 2-3 minutes and write as fast as physically possible without stopping, prioritizing speed over coherence. This overwhelms the filtering mechanism by not giving it time to operate.

Sleep-Boundary Writing: Write immediately upon waking or when extremely tired, when the prefrontal cortex (responsible for much filtering) is less active. The hypnagogic state between wakefulness and sleep is neurologically similar to certain aspects of the ketamine experience.

Sensory Overload: Write while exposing yourself to unusual or intense sensory input (strange textures against your skin, unusual tastes, kaleidoscopic visuals) to overwhelm normal sensory processing.

Perspective Hopping: Rapidly switch between first, second, and third person within a single narrative flow without transitional phrases.

Word Association Chains: Start with a word, write the first association that comes to mind, then use that as the prompt for the next word, creating chains of association rather than logical progression.

Voice Recording Transcription: Speak stream-of-consciousness into a voice recorder while in a relaxed state, then transcribe exactly as spoken, preserving all stammers, half-thoughts, and unusual syntax.

Algorithmic Writing: With algorithmic writing, you might find interesting results by creating simple rule sets for yourself rather than complex computer algorithms. For example, alternate between three different writing positions: extremely close (microscopic bodily detail), normal perspective, and impossibly distant (cosmic scale) following a pattern like 1-2-3-2-1, etc.

Dialogic Writing: Developed from Mikhail Bakhtin's theories and used in narrative therapy. Create dialogues between different aspects of self or experience, letting them converse without imposing a unifying perspective.

Image-Text Oscillation: Work rapidly between visual art and writing, letting each modality influence the other without conscious translation. Art therapists use this to access different cognitive processing modes simultaneously.

Surrealist Automatism: Developed by the Surrealists, this involves writing or drawing without conscious control, letting the unconscious mind lead. Research shows this activates different brain networks than deliberate creation. Visual artists like André Masson and writers like André Breton used this to access deeper creative states.


Erasure/Redaction: Take an existing text and selectively erase words to create something new. Poet Mary Ruefle has turned this into a sophisticated art form, and it's used in therapy to help patients reframe narratives.
