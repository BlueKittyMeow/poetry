1. writing or drawing without conscious control

2. dialogues between different aspects of self or experience, letting them converse without imposing a unifying perspective

3. alternate between three different writing positions: extremely close (microscopic bodily detail), normal perspective, and impossibly distant (cosmic scale) following a pattern like 1-2-3-2-1, etc.

4. Rapidly switch between first, second, and third person within a single narrative flow without transitional phrases
