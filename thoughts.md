Ate. Starving, literally, by the definition of the word. Clearly it was physiologically necessary. I had an image and a phrase in my head as I watched the process - "set upon it like a starved man" and as I ran my index finger around the edge to get every single grit, I felt like I had seen this in film or in my minds eye in a book.

I was just a bit behind myself, it was interesting to observe such a basic biological hunger response

It was clearly not indulgent because that level of desperation only comes from prolonged deprivation. Watching myself like watching a man from the dust bowl fall upon a cup of soup was fascinating. I felt for "him" and how famished he was. "Seems like only yesterday I left my mind behind. Down in a gypsy cafe with a friend of a friend of mine."

I wasn't present though, that's the beauty. I was just able to watch the famished man and feel the twinge of empathy and, were "I" actually there watching the scene, I would wordlessly have slid another bowl over to him so he would have more and be spared the indignity of having to lick the bowl clean. Human empathy and kindness for a soul that is not mine. It let me just observe as if it were someone else.

Usually dissociation is not viewed positively but there are times I find it helpful and this ended up being one of them. It was entirely involuntary, though appreciated, perhaps a surge of endorphins essentially bucked me off the horse of myself!
