Some Advice on the Topic of Bathing

Forget forest bathing. 

Or rather don't forget it but
set this aside as the limit. 
We are always drawing these lines. 

Have you considered garden baths?  
Wash your ears with morningsong twit twit, 
Bathe yourself beneath the dull bee buzz. 

Or what about field bathing, what of that? 
Washing off in plant shoots cutting 
razor-burned bare legs.

Even river, inlet, sea bathing,
(perhaps too literal) 
but doesn't it lay its gentle hands, 
of seaweed or of reeds,
upon us with a benediction? 

Even chickens in their dirt baths 
show how to take the moments in their slices 
like a deck of cards 
fanned before us 
from which we pick a few. 
The Jack of hearts, 
the three of spades, 
the two of clubs. 

We can ponder what it means or
let it sink 
back to the
darkness of our subconscious,
drowsing in the shade. 

Do you remember that one dreamlike day - 
we set upon the marsh, 
low tide,
and received the 
baptism of mud? 
We went like penguins 
down the tidal slopes, 
bathing ourselves in mud till we 
washed clean
coated in a 
cracking set of skin. 

We picked it off throughout the afternoon, 
eventually rejoining all society,
perhaps not quite fit for it,
but better set to hide
the wild  ministrations of our dip. 

Bathe in the forest, but find
the feral hungry parts of your soul
in a peony,
in the silken dirt of a furrow you scratch beneath your nails,
in a seaweed wrapped embrace. 

In a handful of dust. 
Take my dusty hand in yours. 
The afternoon awaits.
